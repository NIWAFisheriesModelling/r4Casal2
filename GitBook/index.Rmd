# Welcolme to **r4Casal2**

This book demonstrates functionality of the `r4Casal2` R package. This is an R package that works with the `Casal2` base R-library [found here](https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/CASAL2/tree/master/R-libraries), although it is advised to use the R-library that is included with the Casal2 binary and usermanual you acquired. The `Casal2` base R-library is responsible for reading in output and interacting with Casal2 configuration files. The `r4Casal2` R package has been built for summarising and visualising objects read in from the base `Casal2` R-library.

All functions in this package should be documented using the `roxygen` syntax with input parameters available using the `?` query. For example `?get_fisheries`. To get a list of functions and general info on the package you can use `library(help="r4Casal2")` or see Section \@ref(functionlist) for another list

```{r install_packages, results = 'hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(r4Casal2)
library(Casal2)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)
```

The core functionality of `r4Casal2` are its accessor functions. These are functions that will return a specific object from a range of Casal2 objects in long format that are `ggplot`, `dplyr` friendly. Most accessors start with `get_` and should be self explanatory. There are some plotting functions, but I have found that I often want to custom ggplots and so mainly have custom plots. The accessors are coded to deal with three types of outpus. These are;

* `extract.mpd()` where Casal2 has been run with default report style. These objects are of class `casal2MPD` which are set by the Casal2 base function
* `extract.mpd()` where Casal2 has been run with tabular reports `casal2 --tabular` or `casal2 -t`. These objects are of class `casal2TAB` which are set by the Casal2 base function
* `list` this is a list of `casal2MPD` which is a useful format for comparing MPD runs see Section \@ref(summarisemultipleinputs)
