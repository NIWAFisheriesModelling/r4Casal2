#' extract_reweighted_mpds
#' @description this function will read in a set of re-weighted models as list so you can
#' plot and integreate the effect of data-weightings. This expects model outputs produced
#' by the function run_automatic_reweighting
#' @param reweighting_path path of the directory that contains the estimated output
#' @details this function expects there to be a range of outputed files with the following filename structure "estimate_'weighting iteration'.log,
#' where 'weighting iteration' is an integer.
#' @return a names list of mpd that can be accessed with the get_ and plot_ methods.
#' @rdname extract_reweighted_mpds
#' @export extract_reweighted_mpds
