Estimates were removed because of matching lower and upper bounds. Originally had 33 estimates, now have 16
The categories 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 were not used in @process[type=recruitment]. This may be expected for models that have categories that are not used at the beginning of the model e.g. tagged categories.
