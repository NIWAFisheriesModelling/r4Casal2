\title{Tail effective sample size (tail-ESS)}
\usage{
ess_tail(sims)
}
\arguments{
\item{sims}{A 2D array _without_ warmup samples (# iter * # chains).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value for the tail effective sample size.
}
\description{
Compute tail effective sample size estimate (tail-ESS) for one parameter.
Tail-ESS is useful for generic diagnostic for the sampling
efficiency in the tails of the posterior. It is defined as
the minimum of the effective sample sizes for 5% and 95% quantiles.
